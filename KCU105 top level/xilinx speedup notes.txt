KCU105 125MHz clock comes from Si5335 which has typical period jitter of 10ps.  This is significantly lower than Xilinx default of 80ps.  
Optimize clock jitter settings to get maximum timing margin

part temperature grade?

vivado settings
synthesis
directive - performanceOptimized - try others?
retiming  - doesn't do anything
fsm_extraction - one_hot vs auto
keep_equivalent_registers - 
resource_sharing - off
-no_lc  - off.  setting this true causes the LUT usage to go way up - more than what the part can hold.  maybe try it on a single module?

-retiming is supposed to optimize pipeline register positions.  I can't get it to work.  emailed Jeff 6/15/21

implementation


timing constraints
set multipath cycle constraints for nets that change infrequently like the work package input and the nonce output
