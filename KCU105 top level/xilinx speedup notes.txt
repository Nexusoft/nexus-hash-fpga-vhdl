KCU105 125MHz clock comes from Si5335 which has typical period jitter of 10ps.  This is significantly lower than Xilinx default of 80ps.  
Optimize clock jitter settings to get maximum timing margin

part temperature grade?

vivado settings
synthesis
directive - performanceOptimized - try others?
retiming  - doesn't do anything
fsm_extraction - one_hot vs auto
keep_equivalent_registers - 
resource_sharing - off
-no_lc  - off.  setting this true causes the LUT usage to go way up - more than what the part can hold.  maybe try it on a single module?

-retiming is supposed to optimize pipeline register positions.  I can't get it to work.  emailed Jeff 6/15/21

#timing constraints
set multipath cycle constraints between fast and slow clocks.  make sure all transitions between fast and slow domain are stretched out or buffered appropriately to avoid metastability.
set_multicycle_path -setup -start -from [get_clocks *hash_clk*] -to [get_clocks *sys_clk*] 8
set_multicycle_path -hold -from [get_clocks *hash_clk*] -to [get_clocks *sys_clk*] 7
set_multicycle_path -setup -from [get_clocks *sys_clk*] -to [get_clocks *hash_clk*] 8
set_multicycle_path -hold -end -from [get_clocks *sys_clk*] -to [get_clocks *hash_clk*] 7


module level synthesizer settings
set_property BLOCK_SYNTH.LUT_COMBINING 0 [get_cells nxs_hash/sk1024/skein]

lowering the clock frequency from 375 to 350 made the congestion worse and the router had a hard time.  
Why?  maybe the placer did not work as hard to spread out the design because the timing constraints were easier?
